# KNN-Classifier-Iris-Dataset
A Python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify Iris flower species based on their features. Includes model training, testing, and evaluation with detailed metrics.
## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier using the Iris dataset. The KNN algorithm is a simple and effective supervised learning method used for classification tasks. In this project, the classifier predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features such as petal and sepal dimensions.

## Dataset
The **Iris dataset** is a widely used dataset for machine learning classification tasks. It contains the following:
- **Features**: 
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
- **Labels**:
  - Iris-setosa
  - Iris-versicolor
  - Iris-virginica

The dataset is included in a CSV file named `iris.csv`.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
